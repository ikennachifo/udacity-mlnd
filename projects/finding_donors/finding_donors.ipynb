    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "The most appropriate models in this instance for this partcular problem would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines (SVCs)** is a great model for face detection through classification of parts of the image as a face and 'not-face', usually creating a square boundary around the face. (See More: https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-svm/). SVCs are great for modelling nonlinear occurences after choosing an appropriate kernel method(pattern analysis to see relations in datasets). As great as this may sound, it can tend to overfit when the data is noisy and overlaps alot. Let's not also forget about how delicate the kernel paramaters are to the model. Due to how good it is with classification given features such as age in our dataset, which could help it predict the income level. I think it could be a good fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guassian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)** is a shockingly powerful algorithm  used for predictive modeling, for instance in a spam email classifier program, to decide if an email should be sent to spam or the inbox. (See More: https://machinelearningmastery.com/naive-bayes-for-machine-learning/). GaussianNB is very scalable linearly when we give the model more predictors and data points and became quite popular due to its quicker convergence speed than models like Logistic regression.\n",
    "It does however make a very strong assumption on the shape of your data's distribution; that any two features are independent regardless of the output class, hence it's name, 'Naive'. It would also perform poorly when the data is not robust enough and with low bias/high variance data points. Considering we bave a few features with a decently low variance and we wish to 'classify', it would be a good fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost)** is an Ensemble method that attempts to make a strong classifier out of weak ones and works well will binary classification problems. It has been use for problems such as determinining if a portion of an image contains a face, or in other cases, detecting the foreground and background.(See more: https://machinelearningmastery.com/boosting-and-adaboost-for-machine-learning/). Adaptive Boosting(AdaBoost) is strong because it can give strength to other weak models like a decision tree classifier with one or two levels and looking at a lot of real-world scenarios, it tends to avoid overfitting data.\n",
    "Noisy data and outliers in our dataset can negatively impact it's performance/accuracy even with iterative training. Considering how clean our data is and almost simple, Adaboost would be good in maximizing the accuracy when it comes to testing with the 20% of our data set aside."

As observed from the plots, AdaBoost and GuassianNB adequately and quickly perfrom training and predictions on the data sets as opposed to SVC which took quite a bit of time to execute. The F-score when 100% of the training set is used clearly indicates AdaBoost has a higher Accuracy than the other models as seen in the plot at the bottom right.\n",

Also, considering how important accuracy is to this particular problem(classifying 50K+ Earners), it'll be advisable to go with this."

    "Hello, Everyone at CharityML, After processing through the provided dataset and pre-evaluating how to approach predicting what you want, I am of the opinions you proceed with **AdaBoost**; This a boosting algorithm very suitable for predictive learning tasks like this. It is versatile, flexible and can be easily interpreted. If you have various hypothesis or methods to predicting these salary earners, like Just their age or years of experience, well AdaBoost can combine these individual 'learners' to create one much more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Algorithm learns via an iterative approach, with each iteration, the model tries to correct its classification of the data. Depending on how an iteration goes, the model will assign heavier weights to the observations that it didn't classify correctly. In subsequent runs, the algorithm will assign higher weights to data points that were missclassified. This entire approach is repeated for a couple times depending on what the user specifies till it finds the set of weighthed hypothese that when aggregated, will perform optimally on future data."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
